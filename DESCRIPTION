Description: This package simulates single cell RNA sequencing data allowing users to tune the variation of gene-expression on different levels, or simulates single cell RNA-seq data with similar statistical properties to an input experimental dataset. It can be used to benchmark compulational methods for single cell RNA-Seq data, and to assist in experimental design of wet-lab experiments.
