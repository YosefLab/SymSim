\usage{
SimulateTrueCounts(ncells_total, min_popsize, i_minpop = 1, ngenes,
  evf_center = 1, evf_type = "one.population", nevf = 10, n_de_evf = 0,
  impulse = F, vary = "all", Sigma = 0.5, phyla = NULL,
  geffect_mean = 0, gene_effects_sd = 1, gene_effect_prob = 0.3,

}
\arguments{
\item{ncells_total}{number of cells}

\item{min_popsize}{the number of cells}

\item{i_minpop}{specifies which population has the smallest size}

\item{ngenes}{number of genes}

\item{evf_center}{the value which evf mean is generated from}

\item{evf_type}{string that is one of the following: 'one.population','discrete','continuous'}

\item{nevf}{number of evfs}

\item{n_de_evf}{number of differential evfs between populations}

\item{Sigma}{parameter of the std of evf values within the same population}

\item{phyla}{the cell developmental tree if chosing 'discrete' or 'continuous' evf type. Can either be generated randomly or read from newick format file using the ape package}

\item{gene_effect_prob}{the probability that the effect size is not 0}

\item{bimod}{the amount of increased bimodality in the transcript distribution, 0 being not changed from the results calculated using evf and gene effects, and 1 being all genes are bimodal}

\item{param_realdata}{pick from zeisel.imputed or zeisel.pop4}

\item{randseed}{random seed}

\item{SE}{return summerized experiment rather than a list of elements, default is False}

\item{gene_effect_sd}{the standard deviation of the normal distribution where the non-zero effect sizes are dropped from}

\item{match_params_den}{empirical density function of the kon,koff and s parameter estimated from real data}
}
\value{
a list of 4 elements, the first element is true counts, second is the gene level meta information, the third is cell level meta information, including a matrix of evf and a vector of cell identity, and the fourth is the parameters kon, koff and s used to simulation the true counts
