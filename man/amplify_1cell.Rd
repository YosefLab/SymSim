\title{This function simulates the amplification, library prep, and the sequencing processes.}
\usage{
amplify_1cell(true_counts_1cell, protocol, rate_2cap = 0.1, gene_len,
  amp_bias, rate_2PCR = 0.8, nPCR = 18, LinearAmp, LinearAmp_coef,
  N_molecules_SEQ)
}
\arguments{
\item{true_counts_1cell}{the true transcript counts for one cell (one vector)}

\item{protocol}{a string, can be "nonUMI" or "UMI"}

\item{rate_2cap}{the capture efficiency for this cell}

\item{gene_len}{gene lengths for the genes/transcripts, sampled from real human transcript length}

\item{amp_bias}{amplification bias for each gene, a vector of length ngenes}

\item{rate_2PCR}{PCR efficiency, usually very high}

\item{nPCR}{the number of PCR cycles}

\item{LinearAmp}{if linear amplification is used for pre-amplification step, default is FALSE}

\item{LinearAmp_coef}{the coeficient of linear amplification, that is, how many times each molecule is amplified by}

\item{N_molecules_SEQ}{number of molecules sent for sequencing; sequencing depth}
}
\value{
read counts (if protocol="nonUMI") or UMI counts (if protocol="UMI)
}
